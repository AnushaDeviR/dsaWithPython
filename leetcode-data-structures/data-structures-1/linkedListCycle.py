''' 
Explanation: 
By using Floydâ€™s algorithm (cycle-finding algorithm) which uses 2 pointers - slow, fast method where slow starts at the 0th index and fast is at slow += 2. So when slow == fast then it means that there is a cycle. When a cycle exists in a LL no matter what slow and fast meets at a same node.
